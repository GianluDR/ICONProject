# MaternalHealthRisk
University Project - Development of a Maternal Health Support Application

The main purpose of our application is to provide support to women during the maternity period in recognizing risks to their own health or that of their child, especially in areas with less health care. Precisely, a dataset of data collected from IoT devices in various hospitals and clinics in rural areas of Bangladesh was used. The goal is to recognize and assess the severity of problems and, if necessary, offer appropriate advice and recommendations. To achieve this, we have developed an application in Python that combines a knowledge-based expert system with the use of several learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised.
