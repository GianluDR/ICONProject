# MaternalHealthRisk
University Group Project - Development of a Maternal Health Support Application

During this university project, our team focused on developing an application aimed at providing crucial support to women during the maternity period. The primary objective was to help them recognize and understand potential health risks for both themselves and their infants, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare services. To achieve this, we leveraged a comprehensive dataset derived from IoT devices deployed in hospitals and clinics across rural areas in Bangladesh.

The core functionality of the application was to recognize and assess the gravity of health issues. Subsequently, based on the assessment, the application would offer tailored advice and recommendations. To implement this functionality, we utilized the Python programming language, making effective use of its versatility and extensive libraries.

Key Components and Technologies:

* Python: The core language for implementing the application, allowing for effective integration of various components.
* IoT Data: We harnessed a dataset collected from IoT devices, ensuring a rich and diverse source of information from rural healthcare facilities.
* Knowledge-based Expert System: Integrated a system that utilized a knowledge base to simulate human expertise, aiding in the evaluation of health risks.
* Learning Algorithms (Supervised and Unsupervised): Employed diverse learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the risk assessment process.
